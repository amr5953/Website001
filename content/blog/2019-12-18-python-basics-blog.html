<p>##1. Variables
In Python it is really easy to define a variable and set a value to it.</p>
<p>ex)two = 2
some_number = 10000</p>
<p>##2. Control Flow: conditional statements
“If” uses an expression to evaluate to True or False. If it is True, it executes what it is inside the if statement.</p>
<p>ex)if True:
print(“Hello Python If”)</p>
<p>if 2 &gt; 1:
print(“2 is greater than 1”)</p>
<p>The “else” statement will be executed if “if” expression is false</p>
<p>ex)if 1 &gt; 2:
print(“1 is greater than 2”)
else:
print(“1 is not greater than 2”)</p>
<p>##3. Looping / Iterator
In Python we can iterate in different forms. I’ll talk about 2: while and for.
While Looping: while the statement is True, the code inside the block will be executed. So this code will print the number from 1 to 10.</p>
<p>ex) num = 1</p>
<p>while num &lt;= 10:
print(num)
num += 1</p>
<p>For Looping: you pass the variable “num” to the block and the “for” statement will iterate it for you. This code will print the same as “while” code: from 1 to 10.</p>
<p>ex) for i in range(1, 11):
print(i)</p>
